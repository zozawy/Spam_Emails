ðŸ“§ Spam Email Detection: Model Comparison
This project explores different machine learning techniques for spam email classification, comparing the performance of a standard Decision Tree, XGBoost, Bagging, and a Stacking Classifier.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To evaluate and compare multiple classifiers to determine which model performs best in detecting spam emails based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

ðŸ“Š Models Compared
Decision Tree (baseline model)

XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)

Bagging Classifier (ensemble of decision trees)

Stacking Classifier (meta-model combining predictions of multiple classifiers)

To run the project, you need to install the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost
